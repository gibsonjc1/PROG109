			<p>In my everyday life, most of my free time is spent with my 3 dogs.  My first dog is a Golden Retriever (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Retriever" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>) named Brandy, whom I’ve had since she was 7 weeks old.  Now at XXXXX years old, she’s no spring chicken, but she still loves going to Marymoor, either to go jogging or to play fetch.  My second dog is through marriage… Ridley, an Australian Cattle Dog (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Cattle_Dog" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>) mix (mostly Red Heeler).  My wife and I joke that a big part of the reason we’re together is because Ridley and Brandy loved playing together so much as puppies.  Two years ago, we decided that we needed more chaos in our lives, and got another Aussie Cattle Dog mix (with Blue Heeler markings) and we named her Tilly (short for Matilda, from the unofficial anthem of Australia: <a href=" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEVKUE_ma00" target="_blank">Waltzing Matilda</a>).  Every weekend we exercise our pack at the dog park, unless we take them hiking or backpacking.</p>
			<br>
			<p>What I really live for though, is travel and SCUBA diving.  Before meeting my wife, most my travel experience was before I was a teenager, with the one notable exception when my mom and I went to Kenya and Tanzania to go on safari and climb Mt Kilimanjaro (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Kilimanjaro" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>).  Unfortunately, I came down with viral pneumonia my second night in Africa, and while I was still able to enjoy the safari, I only made it up to 13,000 ft before I had to turn back with 103-degree fever.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Since meeting my wife, I’ve gotten back into traveling.  Her first time outside of the US and Canada was when I proposed to her in Florence, Italy, on our hotel’s terrace, looking out over the Duomo (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Cathedral" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>). After that, our next international trip was our honeymoon in the Maldives, diving on a liveaboard dive boat, as well as South Africa to see Cape Town and go on safari.  This was my wife’s first time SCUBA diving, other than her certification dives here in Seattle, so the amazing visibility and warm water was a welcome change for her.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Although Mexico has less visibility than most other diving I’ve done, without a doubt my most memorable dive was off Playa del Carmen where we encountered our second whale shark (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale_shark" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>).  We had been lucky enough to snorkel with one in the Maldives the year before, but most divers never get to see these endangered giants, as they generally try to avoid people.  For whatever reason, this whale shark in Mexico circled us at about 30 ft of depth, before swimming away.  Another memorable encounter from that trip was diving with pregnant bull sharks (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bull_shark" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>) on our first day.</p>

			<p>Most recently, we spent two weeks in Thailand, one of those weeks spent SCUBA diving off the Similan Islands from an old sailing ship, affectionately known as The Junk, made famous from it's appearance in the James Bond movie <a href="https://thejunk.com/movies/" target="_blank">The Man with the Golden Gun</a>  .  While the water was amazing, unfortunately between the Christmas Tsunami from the Sumatra–Andaman earthquake of 2004 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake_and_tsunami" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>), and vast overfishing, the area had far less life than anywhere else I have dived.</p>
