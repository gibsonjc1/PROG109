		<h3>Spring 2018</h3>			
			<article>
				<h4>PC Analysis & Configuration I/II</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>TECH 215/217</li>
					<li>10 Credits</li>
					<li>Instructor: Rudy Helm</li>
					<li>Presents the basics of PC hardware and software installation and configuration. Students gain hands-on instruction. Course includes about 50% of the competencies required for A+ certification.<br>Topics include:
					
					<ul>
						<li class="list2">BIOS & Motherboards</li>
						<li class="list2">Storage</li>
						<li class="list2">System optimization</li>
						<li class="list2">Printers</li>
						<li class="list2">Virtualization</li>
						<li class="list2">Mobile computing</li>
						<li class="list2">Resource management</li>
						<li class="list2">Installation, configuration, and optimization of operating systems.</li>
						<li class="list2">Introductory network installation and configuration.</li>
						<li class="list2">Basic electrical concepts and measurement.</li>
						<li class="list2">Advanced troubleshooting techniques.</li>
					</ul>
					
					</li>
					<li>I've had a large amount of PC building and repair experience in my life, so going into the class I was expecting it to be almost entirely review for me.  That said I OK without having the option to test out of it as I figured it would be a nice class to take as my first college class in about 15 years, especially while working full time as my employment contract wound down.  In the end, while I did learn some entirely new information, I was surprised with how much of the material I realized that I used to know but had forgotten from lack of use.</li>
				</ul>

		<h3>Summer 2018 (Current Quarter)</h3>
			
			<article>
				<h4>Introduction to Web Development</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>PROG 109</li>
					<li>5 Credits</li>
					<li>Instructor: Maricel Medina-Mora</li>
					<li>Introduces fundamental programming techniques using current web development software. Students design procedures and write computer instructions to solve business problems, learn procedural programming, develop graphical user interfaces for the web and work with events and objects.</li>
					<li>While I had done some simple programming in high school, I hadn’t done any in a complex language, so I was expecting this to be the class where I would need to learn the most this summer.  While I was right about how much I needed to learn, I was surprised at how easily I learned HTML and CSS (the only part that gave me a challenge was floating elements), but how much I struggled with JavaScript, especially DOM model events and passing information back and forth between the HTML page and the JavaScript.  Once the data was within the JavaScript though, I found it my prior experience with loops and if statements really helped me, and I was able to find and fix bugs quickly.</li>
				</ul>
			</article>
			
			<article>
				<h4>Calculus I</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>MATH& 151</li>
					<li>5 Credits</li>
					<li>Instructor: Ryan Bauer</li>
					<li>Introduces the concepts of limits, derivatives, and integrals. Topics include techniques and applications of derivatives of algebraic and transcendental functions. Students begin working with anti-derivatives.</li>
					<li>After not having taken a math class in over 5 years, Bellevue College required me to retake math.  Previously I had taken math though Calculus II, that was over 20 years ago so while I expected a lot of review, I didn’t really expect to learn anything new.  While this was mostly correct I was surprised to learn some new nuances of derivates, like Rolle’s Theorem, l’Hospital’s Rule, and how limits can be used with derivatives, as opposed how I thought that limits stopped being very useful once derivatives were introduced.</li>
				</ul>

			<article>
				<h4>Information Security Essentials</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>IT 128</li>
					<li>5 Credits</li>
					<li>Instructor: Ahmed Saleh</li>
					<li>Introduces concepts and issues related to securing information systems and the development of policies to implement information security controls. Topics include security vulnerabilities, threats, defense measures, and the legal and ethical issues associated with information security. Students will learn how to apply security best practices in multiple security architectures.</li>
					<li>I really didn’t know what to expect from this class, as I felt like I had a handle on how to secure computes in the home environment, but I had no real knowledge of the security in the medium business environments, let alone enterprise environments.  As the class has progressed, I feel like I’m starting to understand most of the overriding principles that go into securing a large network, but I’d a little disappointed that there’s very little practical hands on knowledge being taught.</li>
				</ul>

		<h3>Fall 2018 (Classes I'm registered for but have yet to take)</h3>
			
			<article>
				<h4>CISCO Networking I</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>NSCOM 201</li>
					<li>5 Credits</li>
					<li>Instructor: Tom Lee</li>
					<li>Course provides foundation knowledge in networking. Topics include: network topologies, OSI model, design and documentation, LANs, network media, protocols and routing.</li>
					<li>While I have plenty of experience setting up and maintaining home networks, this will be my first time working with Cisco enterprise equipment, so I expect this class will be almost entirely new information for me. </li>
				</ul>
			</article>
			
			<article>
				<h4>Implementing Server Operating Systems</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>NSCOM 221</li>
					<li>5 Credits</li>
					<li>Instructor: Ahmed Saleh</li>
					<li>Course provides students with the knowledge and skills necessary to install and configure a Microsoft Windows server operating system for storage, virtualization, and high availability. This course also examines security features of the Microsoft Windows server operating system.</li>
					<li>I’ve had a small amount of experience working with Windows servers and domains, so I anticipate that some amount of the class will be review, but I’m hopeful that most of it will be new material.</li>
				</ul>
			</article>
			
			<article>
				<h4>Technical Writing</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>ENGL& 235</li>
					<li>5 Credits</li>
					<li>Instructor: Karrin Peterson</li>
					<li>Focuses on the development of professional skills in research, design, and communication of technical information. Emphasis on audience analysis, clear and effective writing style, and use of visual elements, by creating documents in a variety of professional report formats, such as memos, proposals, progress reports, completion reports, and instruction manuals.</li>
					<li>With my professional and technical background and writing manuals for some of the projects I’ve been involved in, I’m not sure how much I’ll learn from this class, but it is a requirement for my degree.  That said, most of my knowledge has been self-taught though trial and error, so formal training could end up being a large benefit for me.</li>
