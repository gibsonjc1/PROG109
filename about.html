			<blockquote cite="http://theodore-roosevelt.com/trsorbonnespeech.html"><i>It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.</i><br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Excerpt from the speech "Citizenship in a Republic" by Theodore Roosevelt<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Delivered at the Sorbonne in Paris, France on 23 April 1910.</blockquote>
			<p>I’m a firm believer that a person is what their life experiences and choices has made them.  Looking back at the past 41 years, I would say that I was slow to grow and mature as an adult.  Although my teenage years had been a mix of successes and failures, I was utterly unprepared emotionally and psychologically for college and suffered through a series of failures that left me stuck in a rut for my early adulthood.  In fact, other than my age, there was very little difference between me at 19 and me at 31.  At that point in my life I was someone who avoided any responsibility and spent my free time playing video games and watching TV.  Thankfully, a series of events in my life started a chain reaction that got me unstuck, and I rediscovered my love of the outdoors and travel, got my first dog, bought a house, and met my wife.  Now, at 41, I can barely recognize who I was just two years ago, let alone who I was at 32.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Even though my personal life grew tremendously in my 30’s, I couldn’t say the same about my professional career.  I was in a dead-end job, working at the Microsoft employee store in retail management for almost 10 years.  I took that job just before the great recession, and while it was a great job to ride out the economic storm when the housing bubble burst, I knew going in that it offered no opportunity for advancement.  As the years went by and I got better at my job, I plateaued, and although the job was still stressful, my official job responsibilities were not mentally challenging or stimulating anymore.  Aware of this, my bosses tried to give me the odd special project that cropped up, especially if it had to do with technology.  While I appreciated these diversions from the monotony of retail, they didn’t really help to alleviate the numbing misery I felt at work.</p>
			<br>
			<p>At times, I considered leaving and going back to school, but, if I’m honest, I don’t know if I ever would have been willing to take the risk and leave.  That changed last February, when we found out that Microsoft was cancelling my company’s contract to run the store and would instead be running it themselves, which meant that all the current store employees would be out of a job.  This proved to be the proverbial “kick in the butt” I needed to get myself on a new track professionally by going back to school. While finishing up my employment contract, I enrolled in Spring quarter 2018 at Bellevue College. I am now working towards a BAS in Information Systems and Technology, with a specialty concentration in either Programming or Network Administration and Internet Security.  Unsure as which of those two specialties would be the best fit for me, I’m currently working on my prerequisites while also taking some specialized classes in each field, such as <em>Introduction to Web Development.</em></p>
			<br>
			<p>As to what my future holds professionally, I honestly don’t know.  Surprisingly, I’m actually okay with that.  While college has been stressful after such a long hiatus from the classroom, and tuition will be a financial challenge for my wife and I, I haven’t been this happy in a long time. Happy, even when I’m taking 15 credits during a shortened summer quarter, stressed with how many assignments I have, and studying 8 to 10 hours a day, 7 days a week. After so much mental monotony, I’m finally being mentally challenged and stimulated.  As Teddy Roosevelt discussed in my favorite quote, I’m finally daring greatly.</p>
