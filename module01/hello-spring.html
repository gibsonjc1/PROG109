  <h1>It Might as Well Be Spring</h1>
  <h2>Song by Frank Sinatra</h2>
  <p>
    I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
    <br>I'm as jumpy as puppet on a string
    <br>I'd say that I had spring fever
    <br>But I know it isn't spring
    <br>I am starry eyed and vaguely discontented
    <br>Like a nightingale without a song to sing
    <br>O why should I have spring fever
    <br>When it isn't even spring
    <br>I keep I were someone else
    <br>Walking down a strange new street
    <br>And hearing words that I've never head
    <br>From a girl I've yet to meet
    <br>I'm as busy as spider spinning daydreams
    <br>Spinning spinning daydreams
    <br>I'm as giggy as a baby on a swing
    <br>I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud
    <br>Or a robin on the wing
    <br>But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
    <br>That it might as well be spring
    <br>It might as
    <br>Well be
    <br>Spring
